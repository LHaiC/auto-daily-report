# Daily Report - 2026-02-17

## What I Did Today
- Used an LLM to regularize daily scratch notes
- Tested converting GitHub issues into structured Markdown reports

## Problems / Blockers
- Uncertainty about whether the approach will work

## Root Cause

## Attempts & Fixes
- Successfully generated a structured report from the GitHub issue

## Key Learnings
- LLM can transform raw GitHub issue content into a well-structured daily report

## Metrics
- N/A

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)
